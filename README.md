The project's objective is to automatically detect the RFID tag within a vehicle and present the corresponding toll fee that needs to be paid for toll passage. Upon successful payment, the vehicle can proceed through the gate; otherwise, access will be denied. This initiative aims to reduce traffic and save time for all commuters involved.
